    "\n",
    "1. Data Type Checks\n",
    "Ensuring that each column contains data of the correct type (e.g., numerical, string, datetime) is crucial. Sometimes, numeric values may be incorrectly entered or imported as strings, or vice versa, leading to incorrect data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Null or Missing Values Analysis\n",
    "Identifying and analyzing null or missing values in each column can indicate issues with data collection or processing. While not all missing values represent incorrect data, their presence can impact data analysis and may require imputation or other handling strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use of Automated Data Cleaning Tools\n",
    "Several software tools and libraries (e.g., Pandas in Python, dplyr in R) offer functions and methods for data cleaning, including identifying outliers, handling missing values, and detecting inconsistent data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Data Visualization\n",
    "Visualizing data through histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and other graphical representations can quickly reveal outliers, data clusters, and trends that do not align with expectations. For instance, a box plot might show values that fall far outside the typical range for a column, indicating potential errors or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "Generating descriptive statistics (such as mean, median, mode, min, max, variance, standard deviation) for numerical columns can reveal outliers or values that don't make sense (e.g., negative ages, percentages over 100). For categorical data, examining the frequency of each category can help identify misspellings, inconsistent labeling, or unexpected categories. \n",

    "2.4a The code in 2.4a above performs an encoding of the income column of the task_dataset. Here the income column is a nominal column, and for nominal data, label encoding is the most suitable for encoding. So i imported the label Encoder from sklearn preprocessing, then encoded and tranformed the income column with le.fit_transform(data['income']) and assigned it into data['income'] as an input.\n",

    "2.4b. The code in 2.4b performs an ordinal encoding of the education column. i first imported OrdinalEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing, selected education as the column for ordinal encoding being that the Education data is ordered. encoding and transforming the education data was then performed using encoder.fit_transform(data[['education']]) and assigned into data['education'] as an input\n",

    "2.4c The code in 2.4c performs a label encoding of the race column which was selected and assigned into nominal_column. i first imported LabelEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing, encoded and transformed the race data using le.fit_transform(data[nominal_column]) and then assigned it into encoded_race\n",
